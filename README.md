# cyr0n1337 Advanced Packer

> “If they can’t see it, they can’t stop it.” – cyr0n1337

This is a **next-gen advanced packer** built for research, reverse-engineering challenges, and demonstration purposes. Inspired by Themida and VMProtect, this packer combines **virtualization, polymorphism, multi-layer encryption, anti-debug/VM techniques, and self-healing integrity checks** to create a hardened binary wrapper.

## Features

| Component                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **VM / Virtualization**            | Custom virtual machine with extended opcode set, system call support, cryptography instructions, anti-debug checks, and polymorphic execution. Randomized VM instances make static analysis extremely difficult. |
| **Multi-Layer Encryption**         | AES-256, RC4, XTEA, and custom XOR+Rotate layers. Layers are randomly generated for each build. RSA encryption protects keys, making runtime extraction tough.                                                   |
| **Anti-Debug / Anti-VM**           | Detects common debuggers and sandbox environments through NtQueryInformationProcess, CloseHandle exceptions, registry artifacts, MAC addresses, memory artifacts, and timing checks.                             |
| **Self-Healing Checksum**          | Critical code regions are continuously monitored and automatically repaired if tampered with. Supports CRC32, Murmur3, and SHA1-based checksums.                                                                 |
| **Hidden API Calls**               | Resolve API functions by hash at runtime, hiding imports and defeating simple static analysis.                                                                                                                   |
| **Polymorphic Stub & Obfuscation** | Stub is fully polymorphic with runtime signature obfuscation to evade AV detection.                                                                                                                              |
| **Real-World Integration**         | Fully automated build script with OpenSSL integration for encryption, virtualized functions, and integrity enforcement.                                                                                          |

## Build

```batch
build.bat
```

> This script compiles the stub and packer using MSVC and OpenSSL. Output binaries are ready for testing in controlled environments.

## Notes

* This project is for **educational purposes only**.
* Always test in **isolated virtual machines**.
* Do **not** deploy on production systems or target networks without authorization.
* Free to use, fork, and modify – perfect for learning advanced packing, obfuscation, and anti-analysis techniques.
